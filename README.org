* Extensions to the =xcms= Bioconductor packages

The =xcmsExtensions= package provides methods and functions extending the
functionality of the xcms Bioconductor package. Ideally, some of them might be
included into the =xcms= package in the long run. At present the package is
however under heavy development and thus far from being complete or stable.

For more information see [[file:vignettes/xcmsExtensions.org]].

** Installation

Using the =devtools= R-package: Note that we also need the development version
of the =ensembldb= package (which will be released with Bioconductor 3.3).

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  library(devtools)
