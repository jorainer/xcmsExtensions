CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.10
------------------------

NEW FEATURES
    o MassrangeFilter implemented.
    o Added a section about the SimpleCompoundDb to the vignette.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.9
------------------------

BUG FIXES
    o RSD (relative standard deviation) was calculated wrong for peakGroupSummary.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.8
------------------------

NEW FEATURES
    o MSslice class has now a slot phenoData.
    o phenoData, assayData, phenoData<-, pData, pData<- methods for MSslice objects.
    o peakGroupSummary method for xcmsSet.
    o Add binning option to visualizeXcmsSet shiny app.

BUG FIXES
    o Fix problem in the shiny app.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.7
------------------------

NEW FEATURES
    o Common ESI adducts from the Fiehn lab added.
    o supportedIonAdducts, mass2adductmz, adductmz2mass methods added to convert
      between adduct M/Z and mass values.
    o mzmatch for SimpleCompoundDb has now the new argument "ionAdduct" that
      allows to calculate the mass given that the provided M/Z is from an adduct.

BUG FIXES
    o msSlice method for xcmsSet objects uses now MulticoreParam as default for
      parallel processing; snow does not work as the workspace would have to
      be copied.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.6
------------------------

NEW FEATURES:
    o [ and [[ subsetting for MSslice objects.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.5
------------------------

NEW FEATURES:
    o Added shiny app to visualize xcmsSet objects.
    o Added an example of an /extended/ xcms workflow to the vignette.
    o Added subset method for MSdata and MSslice objects.
    o Added names slot and related methods for MSslice objects.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.4
------------------------

NEW FEATURES:
    o SimpleCompoundDb object allowing a simple compound identification.
    o SimpleCompoundDb instance containing some basic compound data from
      HMDB.
    o binMz, binRtime and binMzRtime for MSslice objects.
    o matchmz method to match M/Z values allowing some shift.
    o compounds method for the SimpleCompoundDb along with lots of internal infrastructure
      work.
    o CompoundidFilter (extending BasicFilter from the ensembldb package).
    o matchmz method for SimpleCompoundDb database.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.3
------------------------

      dimensions.
    o mapMatrix: extract the data as a two-dimensional Matrix (sparseMatrix).
    o getChromatogram, getSpectrum for MSslice objects.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.2
------------------------

NEW FEATURES:
    o New methods rtranges, mzranges, [, [[ for MSsliceList objects.
    o msSlice for xcmsSet objects.
    o getChromatogram, plotChromatogram, getSpectrum and plotSpectrum methods
